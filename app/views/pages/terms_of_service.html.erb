By using or visiting the MarchBNB (MBNB) website or any MBNB products, software, data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the MBNB website (collectively the “Service”) you signify your agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the “Terms of Service”).  If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Service.</p>
<p>Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version which is posted at  <a href="http://www.marchbnb.com/terms_of_service">http://www.marchbnb.com/terms_of_service</a>.  MBNB may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.  Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service</p>
<p>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service.  “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, media, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.  The Service includes all aspects of MBNB, including but not limited to all products, software, applications, and/or services offered via the MBNB website, if any.</p>
<p>The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by MBNB.  MBNB has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, MBNB will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.  By using the Service, you expressly relieve MBNB from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third Party Accounts</p>
<p>In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a Facebook or Google Account.  You may never use another’s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.  You must notify the third party website (e.g., Facebook or Google) immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>Although MBNB will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of MBNB or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</p>
<p>MBNB hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without MBNB’s prior written authorization, unless MBNB makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service.</p>
<p>You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the pages of the Service itself or other explicitly authorized means MBNB may designate.</p>

B)  the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or<br>
C) the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from MBNB appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>Prohibited commercial uses do not include any use that MBNB expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the MBNB servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, MBNB may grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.  MBNB reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and MBNB’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  MBNB reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes.  Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.

OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
