If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Service.

Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version which is posted at  http://www.marchbnb.com/terms_of_service.  MBNB may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.  Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.

2. Service

These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service.  “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, media, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.  The Service includes all aspects of MBNB, including but not limited to all products, software, applications, and/or services offered via the MBNB website, if any.

The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by MBNB.  MBNB has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, MBNB will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.  By using the Service, you expressly relieve MBNB from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.

Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

3. Third Party Accounts

In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a Facebook or Google Account.  You may never use another's account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.  You must notify the third party website (e.g., Facebook or Google) immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

Although MBNB will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of MBNB or others due to such unauthorized use.

MBNB hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:
